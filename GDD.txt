* GAMEPLAY *
************

* First person perspective

* Fast-paced, "fluid" movement
    - High movement speed
    - Medium jump height, long jump distance
    - Climb ledge

* Chaotic, fast-paced gameplay
    - Numerous environmental hazards that will need to be avoided (fire spreading, exposed electric wire, etc.)
    - Breaches in the hull and damage to internal ship systems require the player to move around frequently, or risk losing the ship and their lives
    - Oxygen levels in a room decrease the longer a hull breach is left unchecked
    - Progress based on time alive

* MECHANICS *
*************

* Repair mechanic
    - Simple system where the player holds a button for X seconds while standing near and looking at the hull breach.

* Hull breach ruptures (idea 1)
    - Maximum of three ruptures at any given time.
    - Once a rupture is repaired, a delay will begin, after which a new rupture will occur (handled in GameMode via events)
    - Every minute, the delay between ruptures decreases by a very small amount.
    - Each rupture has a boolean called "isRuptured" and a float (or int?) value that corresponds to its integrity. 100 corresponds to fully repaired.

* Oxygen system
    - Each room should have its own oxygen levels, which can be affected by hull breaches
    - Each room has one or more doors which can affect the flow of oxygen from other rooms.
        * Example: Room A has a hull breach, and the door which leads to Room B is open. 
        Oxygen levels in both rooms will begin to deplete until the door is closed. 
        Once it is closed, Room B's oxygen levels will stabilize, while Room A will continue to leak until the breach is repaired.
    - Larger rooms have more oxygen, take longer to deplete?
